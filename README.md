Litle XML Documentation repository
----------------------------------
This repository contains Litle & Co.'s XML schema and XML API documentation.

Relationship to our SDK's
-------------------------
Our language specific SDK's all utilize the Litle XML format for processing.  There is a one to one correlation between
the SDK model and our XML format.  If you need details regarding the validation rules for a specific field, or detailed
information regarding a specific field our XML guide will provide the information you need.

Each of our SDK's specifiies the version of Litle XML it is designed for.

If you need further support please contact us, we'd love to help.
